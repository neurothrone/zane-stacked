# ZaneStacked - The Only CV That Knows It's Being Watched

## Description

Welcome to **ZaneStacked**, the full-stack developer CV profile that's so futuristic, even I question if I built it or
if it built me. Built with Blazor WebAssembly and .NET Minimal API, this project showcases my skills, projects, and an
unhealthy obsession with dark humor.

## Tech Stack

- **Blazor WebAssembly Frontend**: Because writing JavaScript is *so* 2023.
- **.NET Minimal API Backend**: Minimal but not *that* minimal.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Because manually writing SQL is for the brave.
- **Identity Authentication**: Only *real* admins allowed. No bots, no hackers, no nosey recruiters.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Because I believe in UI *and* UX.
- **High Lighthouse Score Goal**: Trying to hit 85+ in Lighthouse. If it fails, I'll blame Google.
- **Azure Hosting**: Deployed on the cloud, where all dreams and questionable design choices live.
- **Azure SQL Server & Storage**: Because saving images locally is *so* last decade.

## Setup

### Backend Setup (ZaneStacked.Api)

Environment variables are stored in `appsettings.json` for simplicity. You *could* change them to environment variables,
but why make life harder? Just update the following:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "AzureConnection": "azure-sql-server-connection-string"
  },
  "ApiUrl": "backend-base-url",
  "ClientUrl": "frontend-base-url",
  "ExcusesApiUrl": "excuses-base-api-url"
}
```

### Frontend Setup (ZaneStacked.Web)

Same drill for the frontend: `wwwroot/appsettings.json` holds the secrets. Change as needed:

```json
{
  "ApiUrl": "backend-base-url"
}
```
